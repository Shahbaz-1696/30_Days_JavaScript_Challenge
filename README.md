## Day-5: Functions

- Understand and define functions using function declarations, expressions and arrow functions.
- Use function parameters and default values effectively.
- Create and utilize higher order functions.
- Apply functions to solve common problems and perform calculations.

## Day-6: Arrays

- Create and manipulate arrays using various methods.
- Transform and aggregate array data using `map`, `filter` and `reduce`.
- Iterate over arrays using loops and iteration methods.
- Understand and work with multi-dimensional arrays.

## Day-7: Objects

- Create and manipulate objects with properties and methods.
- Understand and use the `this` keyword in object methods.
- Work with nested objects and array of objects.
- Iterate over an object's properties using loops and built-in methods.

## Day-8: ES6+ Features

- Understand and use template literals for string interpolation and multi-line strings.
- Apply destructuring to extract values from arrays and objects.
- Utilize spread and rest operators for array manipulation and function arguments.
- Define functions with default parameters.
- Create objects using enhanced object literals, including methods and computed property names.

## Day-9: DOM Manipulation:

- Select and manipulate DOM elements using Javascript.
- Create and append new elements to the DOM.
- Remove elements from the DOM.
- Modify attributes and classes of HTML elements.
- Add and handle events to make web pages interactive.

## Day-10: Event Handling:

- Add an handle basic events like click, double-click, mouseover, mouseout, keydown and keyup.
- Understand and handle form events.
- Implement event delegation to manage events on dynamically added events.
- Make web pages inetractive by responding to various user actions.

## Day-11: Promises & Async:Await:

- Understand and create promises, including handling resolved and rejected states.
- Chain multiple promises to perform sequential asynchronous operations.
- Use async/await to handle asynchronous code more readably.
- Fetch data from public APIs using both promises and async/await.
- Manage multiple concurrent promises using `Promise.all` and `Promise.race`.

## Day-12: Error Handling:

- Understand and implement basic error handling using try-catch blocks.
- Use finally blcoks to execute code regardless of the try-catch outcome.
- Create and use custom error classes.
- Handle errors in promises using `.catch()` and within async functions using try-catch.
- Implement graceful error handling when making network requests with the `fetch` API.

## Day-13: Modules:

- Create and export functions, objects, and constants using modules.
- Import modules using named and default imports.
- Use third-party modules installed via npm.
- Understand the basics of module bundling.
